======== Schoolfield Object.py ========
Single file implementation of the Schoolfield-Sharpe model of growth.

No paramters, all paths set in script.

Outputs fits as png plots to ../Results

========== General_Models.py ==========
Implementation of four different growth models.

All models inherit methods from the basic growth_model class.  

Automatically selects and plots the best model for the dataset - this isn't 100% functional right now.

Creates a CSV of results in ../results/
Output names indicate model used:
BA = Boltzman Ahrrenius model
O = Original three factor Schoolfield model
OS = Simplified two factor Schoolfield model
TF = Two factor schoolfield model using peak temperatures rather than enzzyme rate estimates

========== Models_R_Output.py ==========
Modified version of General_Models. Instead of plotting outputs CSV to allow curve plotting in R. 

This is super slow because I'm lazy, only use with small datasets!
