The value of TPK on all graphs is estimated by numerically evaluating the growth curve function for its maxima. It is NOT the tpk from the observed data - there will therefore be some errors where the fitting did not work properly. 

Bacteria_Sources: Locations of species when available, not exhaustive has has some stacking issues due to scale. Accuracy is at least 10 miles. 

Growth_Range: T range is calculated as the difference between Tpk and the temperature at which growth occurs at 75% of its maximum rate (to the left of Tpk). 

Response_Size: Data filtered for specific growth rates only (about 450 datapoints). There are some outliers not shown on this graph as they were in the 10000's which suggested to me that there was some error in either the fit or the data. 

The other graphs are hopefully fairly self explanatory.
